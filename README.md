# NM function

+ this project is a replica of the nm function from bash(it shows the symbols
of an elf file)

+ state of the project: achieved basic functionality for ELF64
(because is just the basic functionality it is also faster than
the original function)

+ planning to introduce multiplu file types recognition like ELF32 also
adding the option to print the dynamic symbols
